    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rugelach (pronounced rug-a-lah) are tiny filled pastries that originated in the Jewish communities of Poland. To make rugelach, a cream cheese-sour cream dough is cut into wedges and rolled around a sugary walnut-raisin filling. Rugelach is served year round, but itâ€™s especially popular on Jewish holidays, such as Hanukkah.</p>
